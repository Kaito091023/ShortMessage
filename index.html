                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is beautiful,&nbsp;but not like those girls in the magazines.&nbsp;She is beautiful,&nbsp;for the
                way she thought.&nbsp;She is beautiful,&nbsp;just like the sparkle in her eyes when she talked
                about something she loves.&nbsp;She is beautiful, for her ability to make other people smile,
                even if she was the complete opposite.&nbsp;No,&nbsp;she wasn't beautiful for something as temporary
                as her looks.&nbsp;She is beautiful,&nbsp;not just her face but also deep down to her soul.
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though loving you felt like a book out in the wind,&nbsp;the pages turned too fast for me to read.
                I didn't get enough time to adore you,&nbsp;to explore you,&nbsp;to trace your lines with my fingertips
                and re-read my favorite parts.&nbsp;To live the story I knew we were meant to be,&nbsp;before I knew it,
                the book was closed,&nbsp;the story was over.&nbsp;Maybe in another lifetime,&nbsp;we'll meet again,&nbsp;tangi.
