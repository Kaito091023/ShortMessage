                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's beautiful,&nbsp;but not like those girls in the magazines.&nbsp;She's beautiful,&nbsp;for the
                way she thought.&nbsp;She's beautiful,&nbsp;just like the sparkle in her eyes when she talked
                about something she loves.&nbsp;She's beautiful, for her ability to make other people smile,
                even if she was the complete opposite.&nbsp;No,&nbsp;she wasn't beautiful for something as temporary
                as her looks.&nbsp;She's beautiful,&nbsp;not just her face but also deep down to her soul.

                me to read,&nbsp;I'll still choose you.&nbsp;Even if I didn't get the chance to adore you,&nbsp;to trace your
                lines with my fingertip and re-read my favorite parts,&nbsp;I'll still choose you.&nbsp;To live the story
                I know we're meant to create together,&nbsp;where each chapter unfolds with new adventures
                and joy.&nbsp;I look forward to the many pages yet to be written in our beautiful tale, tangi.
